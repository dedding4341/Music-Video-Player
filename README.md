# Music-Video-Player
Personal Project For Winter 2016, Java-Based Music/Video Player!

In order to run this program first clone this repository. After you have cloned it, navigate to the location using either
Terminal/Command Prompt. After locating the reposistory execute the following code to compile:

javac -cp src/main/java src/main/java/runner/*.java src/main/java/model/*.java src/main/java/view/*.java src/main/java/controller/*.java

And execute the following code to run:

java -cp src/main/java runner.MusicPlayer

This is a personal project I decided to pick up after thinking that it would be cool to try to create my own personal Music system!
In order to operate this program just copy/paste a youtube link of the video that you desire to watch into the text box at the 
bottom of the window.

NOTE: Only videos that youtube allows to be embedded will work with this application!
