# Music-Video-Player
Personal Project For Winter 2016, Java-Based Music/Video Player!

This is a personal project I decided to pick up after thinking that it would be cool to try to create my own personal Music system!
In order to operate this program just copy/paste a youtube link of the video that you desire to watch into the text box at the 
bottom of the window.

For Further instructions on how to operate, please read the instructions document included!

NOTE: Only videos that youtube allows to be embedded will work with this application!
